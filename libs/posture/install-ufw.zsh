    #? Install UFW: During installation, make sure to install ufw. On most Ubuntu or Debian-based distributions, it's installed by default, but you can ensure it by running:
    sudo apt install ufw

    #? Enable UFW: After installation is complete and before configuring the system further, enable the firewall:
    sudo ufw enable

    #? Configure Firewall Rules: Depending on the services you're running (e.g., SSH, HTTP), configure the rules:
    sudo ufw allow ssh
    sudo ufw allow http
    sudo ufw allow https

    #? Ensure UFW Starts on Boot: UFW should automatically start on boot once enabled, but you can ensure this by running:
    sudo systemctl enable ufw
